Frontend Task
Curriculum Authoring Tool
Task:
Create a tool for teachers to author curriculum for a subject. Please watch
the tool in action from the PDF/GIF included along with the task.
Basic functionalities:
● Row actions
1. Indent & Outdent - see GIF
2. Delete - will delete the node along with its children
3. Move action - Move nodes around in the curriculum using
Drag-Drop or Up-Down arrow icons as shown in the GIF.
● The text in each row should be editable like a text box
Bonus functionalities: Extra points for attempting these :)
● Load/ Save - Implement 2 buttons - One that “Saves” the JSON data of
the curriculum structure created by the user to a file and other that
“Loads” the JSON file to recreate the structure in UI. Much like the
save/load functionality in a game.
● Host the working solution
Please note:
• Moving, deleting should preserve parent-child relations between nodes
Eg. deleting a node should also delete its children
• You are free to use any presentational framework (React, Vue, Angular)
• No need to implement Backend
